This is an agent based model simulation programmed in NetLogo which models the targeted spread of misinformation for the purposes of information warfare. For example, the type of information warfare Russia wages against the free world. It's abstracted above that, so any "misinformation agent" (not necessarily Russia) invests in a propaganda apparatus which we control with the slider %-beginning-convinced. (So %-beginning-convinced abstracts away the misinformation agent and their propaganda apparatus into the first push of people who believe the lie). 



Percent of what? The target population shown below are the people that the Misinformation Agent is trying to convince. For example, if a hostile country intends to spread propaganda in a target country, the people being lied to, are the target population. The color coding is because we make some assumptions about the target population. Namely blue and white are polarized “teams/parties”. The cyan people are gullible, and the yellow people are cautious

The misinformation agent does not explicitly exist in the model, nor does their propaganda apparatus, they are both implicit in the slider you can control called “%-beginning-convinced”. So, in a sense you are the misinformation agent! Technically “%-beginning-convinced” will set that percentage of the target population who will turn green signifying that they believe whatever lie the Misinformation Agent was trying to convince them of.
